     <p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and
          1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix
          operating system.During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely
          used programming languages, with C compilers available for practically all modern computer
          architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original language
          designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language.C has been standardized
          since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for
          Standardization (ISO).</p>

     <h2>C++ Language</h2>

     <p>The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C
          subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as "a light-weight
          abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions"
          and "offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what
          distinguishes it from other languages.
          C++ inherits most of C's syntax. The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that
          uses </p>

     <h2>HTML</h2>

          height="300">
     <p>HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
          web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
          multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
          its appearance.

          HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
          interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
          by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
          HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as  directly
          introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not
     display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

     HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content
     of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
     former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
     explicit presentational HTML since 1997.A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio,
     primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.</p>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Z7oz-UE96cn06LU5Uid04gHaEK&pid=Api&P=0&h=220" alt="" width="300"
               height="300">
          <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
               written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
               should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

               CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
               specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously,
               which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or
               even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.

               After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS
               modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
               separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot
               of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have
               version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.</p>

          <h2>JS</h2>
          <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.e9UcoxOTbk15pGvXkyww_AHaEK&pid=Api&P=0&h=220" alt="" width="300"

          <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with
               first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
               non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
               prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
               imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

               JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function
               variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities),
               and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through
               toString()).

               This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web
               pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see
               Web APIs and DOM.

               The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript
               Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to
               document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been
               implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features.
               Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially
               published.</p>

          <h2>REACT</h2>
          <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.AujxjUvL4sVj4zGcYzoaUQHaGL&pid=Api&P=0&h=220" alt="" width="300"
               height="300">
          <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
               building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
               community of individual developers and companies.

               React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like
               Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM,
               React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key
               advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding
               unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.React code is made of entities called
               components.These components are modular and reusable.React applications typically
               consist of many layers of components. The components are rendered to a root element in the DOM using the
               React DOM library. When rendering a component, values are passed between components through props (short
               for "properties"). Values internal to a component are called its state.

               The two primary ways of declaring components in React are through function components and class
               components.</p>

          <h2>NODE</h2>
          <img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.BZlpBU4PHPTUMFEmQs8S7QHaEL&pid=Api&P=0&h=220" alt="" width="300"
               height="300">
          <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux,
               Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a
               web browser.

               Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The
               ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before
               the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere"
               paradigm,unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to
               using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.

               Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to
               optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for
               real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).</p>

          <h2>SQL</h2>
          <img src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SFwbmiOTKTuUGER1gVXX5AHaER&pid=Api&P=0&h=220" alt="" width="300"
               height="300">
          <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) S-Q-L, sometimes "sequel" for historical
               reasonsis a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database
               management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data
               incorporating relations among entities and variables.

               Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM.
               Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it
               eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.

               Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of
               statements,which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL),
               a data definition language (DDL),a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language
               (DML).The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data
               definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a
               declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.

               SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd's relational model. The model was
               described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".
               Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, SQL became the most widely
               used database language.</p>

          <p>Express JS is a small framework that works on top of Node web server functionality to simplify its APIs and
               add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware
               and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP
               objects.
               Express makes the development of Node application very easy and it is very simple to use. It provides a
               simple and efficient way to build web applications and APIs using JavaScript. It helps Node to handling
               routes, requests, and responses, making it easier for you to create robust and scalable applications. As
               it is very flexible, lightweight and easy to learn and contains a ton of middleware option making it an
               excellent choice to learn and use Express in your application.
